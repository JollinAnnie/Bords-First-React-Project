export const ABOUT_ME_DATA = {
  introduction: "Hello! I'm Bords! the unbeatable champion of all things tech and anime. I don’t just code—I code like a master. While most struggle to understand the complexities of software engineering, I breeze through it, effortlessly turning every challenge into a victory.",
  background: "With a PhD in dominating tech from Stanford University (okay, not officially, but close enough), I’ve mastered every corner of programming and cutting-edge tech. From full-stack to AI, there’s nothing I can't conquer. And let’s not forget the secret weapon: my vast knowledge of anime, which fuels my creativity and keeps me ahead of the game.",
  skills: "My technical abilities? Beyond elite. I specialize in crafting software solutions so flawless, they could be considered works of art. Cloud computing, full-stack development, machine learning? I own them all. When I write code, it’s like a manga—each line builds a new world, and every bug is just a plot twist waiting to be conquered.",
  projects: "I’ve built projects that would make even the most seasoned devs sweat. From a recommendation system powered by machine learning (because I don’t do basic) to a distributed framework that boosted efficiency by 40%, my work always goes above and beyond. And yes, I’ve been known to drop a few game-changing side projects, just for fun.",
  interests: "When I’m not rewriting the rules of software development, you’ll find me rock climbing, capturing the perfect photo, or geeking out over the latest anime series. I’m all about pushing limits—whether that’s scaling a cliff or analyzing the latest *Attack on Titan* episode for hidden symbolism. Mentoring future tech legends? Count me in.",
  careerGoals: "I’m on a quest to revolutionize technology, one breakthrough at a time. The future? It’s mine to shape. I’ll keep innovating, keep winning, and make sure that my impact on the world—both in tech and in anime culture—is nothing short of legendary.",
