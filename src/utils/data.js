export const ABOUT_ME_DATA = {
  introduction: "Hello! I'm Bords! the unbeatable champion of all things tech and anime. I donâ€™t just codeâ€”I code like a master. While most struggle to understand the complexities of software engineering, I breeze through it, effortlessly turning every challenge into a victory.",
  background: "With a PhD in dominating tech from Stanford University (okay, not officially, but close enough), Iâ€™ve mastered every corner of programming and cutting-edge tech. From full-stack to AI, thereâ€™s nothing I can't conquer. And letâ€™s not forget the secret weapon: my vast knowledge of anime, which fuels my creativity and keeps me ahead of the game.",
  skills: "My technical abilities? Beyond elite. I specialize in crafting software solutions so flawless, they could be considered works of art. Cloud computing, full-stack development, machine learning? I own them all. When I write code, itâ€™s like a mangaâ€”each line builds a new world, and every bug is just a plot twist waiting to be conquered.",
  projects: "Iâ€™ve built projects that would make even the most seasoned devs sweat. From a recommendation system powered by machine learning (because I donâ€™t do basic) to a distributed framework that boosted efficiency by 40%, my work always goes above and beyond. And yes, Iâ€™ve been known to drop a few game-changing side projects, just for fun.",
  interests: "When Iâ€™m not rewriting the rules of software development, youâ€™ll find me rock climbing, capturing the perfect photo, or geeking out over the latest anime series. Iâ€™m all about pushing limitsâ€”whether thatâ€™s scaling a cliff or analyzing the latest *Attack on Titan* episode for hidden symbolism. Mentoring future tech legends? Count me in.",
  careerGoals: "Iâ€™m on a quest to revolutionize technology, one breakthrough at a time. The future? Itâ€™s mine to shape. Iâ€™ll keep innovating, keep winning, and make sure that my impact on the worldâ€”both in tech and in anime cultureâ€”is nothing short of legendary.",
